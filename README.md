## Problem Statement

AsiaByte Technologies currently experiences operational inefficiencies in its inventory management and order fulfillment processes. These challenges include:

1.	**Inefficient inventory and order planning:** <br>

Manual insertion of product and order details in Excel leads to many information sheets, non-reporting values, and typo-keyed-in details. 

2.	**Stock Mismatch Issues:** <br>

Discrepancies between the personal chat product needs from the customer and the actual product inventory can lead to order cancellations, delivery delays, and negative seller ratings. 

3.	**Non-Priority in Invoice/Supplier Management:** <br>

The absence of a systematic approach for invoice tracking in the stock keeping unit, total product value, and total margin limits the company's ability to optimize procurement costs and ensure reliable supply chains.  


---

## Objectives

To develop and implement a comprehensive Asiabyte P&L Inventory System that streamlines AsiaByte's inventory control, order fulfillment, and supplier management processes, thereby reducing operational costs and enhancing user satisfaction.

1.	**Improve Inventory Planning** <br>

•	Implement Barcode Scanning for quick product intake using Manufacturer Series scanning <br>

•	Develop reporting capabilities for inventory turnover analysis. <br>

•	Establish optimal buffer stock levels for fast-moving and high-value products <br>


2.	**Real-Time Stock Tracking and Order Planning** <br>

•	Implement real-time stock level monitoring across all SKUs <br>

•	Establish automatic synchronization between physical inventory and order/sales platforms <br>

•	Create low-stock alerts and reordering triggers based on predefined thresholds <br>


3.	**Enhance Invoice/Supplier Management** <br>

•	Create a supplier invoice tracking system with key metrics (stock keeping unit, total product value, and total margin) <br>

•	Establish a centralized database for supplier information and product value comparisons <br>

•	Enable data-driven decision making for cost product value in inventory negotiation. <br>
